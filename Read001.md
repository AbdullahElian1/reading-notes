object: In computer programming, each physical thing in 
the world can be represented as an object.

Each object can have its own: 
• Properties 
• Events 
• Methods 

Properties: 
Each property has a name and a value, and each of 
these name/value pairs tells you something about 
each individual instance of the object

Event: Programmers choose which events they respond to. 
When a specific event happens, that event can be 
used to trigger a specific section of the code. 

Methods :
Methods typically represent how people (or other 
things) interact with an object in the real world.
