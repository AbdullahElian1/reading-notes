object: In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object.

Each object can have its own: • Properties • Events • Methods

Properties: Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object

Event: Programmers choose which events they respond to. When a specific event happens, that event can be used to trigger a specific section of the code.

Methods : Methods typically represent how people (or other things) interact with an object in the real world.
