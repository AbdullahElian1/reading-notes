Version control

Version control is a system that allows you to see previous versions

and track changes that occur to the file.

There is more than one type of version control such as (CVCS, DVCS).  

 

        Centralized version control


Collaborating with the team on working on a single file led to the

emergence of (CVCS)This system contains single server that saves all changes.

 

        Distributed Version Control systems

There is a problem in controlling the central version, and if the server falls,

the team will not be able to work on one file or save the changes. This led to the emergence

of Distributed Version Control systems and that means there are multiple mirrored repositories.

 

                                         Git

now let's talk about Git and what is that 

git stores data in a file system made up of snapshots and every

time you make a change of the project (called commit)

it saves another snapshot, also Git reduces the possibility of data loss.
