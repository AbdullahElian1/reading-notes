# logical operator

&& (and) to test more than one condition 
if the conditions all true will return true.
|| (or ) to test more than one condition 
if one of the conditions true will return true .
!(not) if false will return true also if true will return false 

# for loop 

for loop will check the condition if true will run a block 
of code then the condition will be checked again until come false
usually, we use it when we know how many times we want to run the code.

# while loop 

like the for loop but usually, we use it if we don't know how many times the code will run.

# do while
 
like the wihle but here the condition will run at least one.
