 # command line

A command line is a text-based interface to the system that allows you to enter the command by the keyboard.

also, we have some command like PWD that mean

Print Working Directory and we have ls that mean to show what you have in the directory.

another thing about the path we have two types of path those are the relative path and absolute path .
